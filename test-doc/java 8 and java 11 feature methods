    1.        The appletviewer tool is available in Java 8.                  The appletviewer tool is not available in Java 11.
     
              Ex:console page another field                                  Ex:same page console
              
              
               
    2.        Java 8 has the AWTUtilities class, which we didn't             In Java 11, the AWTUtilities class is not available.
              recommend you to use because it can break 
              any program depending on it.                
                          
                    
                                                  
    3.         It has fewer string methods.                                 Several new methods of String such as isBlank(), lines(),repeat(n), 
                                                                            stripLeading(), stripTrailing(), and strip() are  introduce.
                          
                  
                          
    4.        No special variables are used for lambda                      Java 11 allows us to use var variables to be used in lambda expressions.
              parameters.              
                          
              Ex:Array.sort(testString,new Comparator                       Ex:Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1,s2)->{return(s1.length()-s2.length());}); 
              <String>(){
              @override
              public int compare(String s1,sTRING S2){
              return (s1.length()-s2.length());
              }});   
             
             
             
                                 
    5.        JMC and JavaFX are available in the Oracle JDK.               JMC and JavaFX are removed from the Oracle JDK in Java 11.
                          
                          
                          
                          
    6.        There are no suitable methods to work with the file.          In Java 11, there are various methods, such as writeString(), readString(), 
                                                                            and isSameFile() which help us to perform several operations on file.
                           
                                                                            Ex:
                                                                            
                                                                            1. Files writeString() methods 
                                                                            public static Path writeStringâ€‹(Path path, CharSequence csq, 
                                                                            OpenOption... options) throws IOException
                          
                                                                            2.files readString methods
                                                                            Files.readString(filePath)
                    
                          
                          
    7.        Pattern recognizing is not possible.                          Pattern recognizing is possible with the help of the asMatchPredicate() method.
