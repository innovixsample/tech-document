Selenium Grid - Selenium Project Setup

Create Maven Project 
Delete default generated packages and java files
Create base package under src/test/java and create Base class under it

Create initializeBrowser(String broswerName) under Base classs and write the code for DesiredCapabilities and RemoteWebDriver - View Code Here

Create tests package under src/test/java and create multiple sample automation tests under tests package as below:
One 
Extend the Base class and call initialize Browser by passing chrome
Write the code - View Code Here
Two
Extend the Base class and call initialize Browser by passing firefox
Write the code - View Code Here

Check Grid status before starting it:
Non UI Version: http://localhost:4444/status

UI Version: http://localhost:4444

Standalone Mode: 
Standalone is a union of all the components of Selenium Grid.
If we want to run Hub and Node in same machine, we can use this mode.

Practical Demonstration:

Create any folder say Jars folder under any location say C Drive etc. 
Download Selenium Standalone from official website and paste into above folder. 
Download different Browser executables and paste them into the same above folder.
java -jar selenium-server-4.0.0.jar standalone


Hub and Node Mode:

Start Hub in the machine using:
java -jar selenium-server-4.0.0.jar hub 

Node in same machine
java -jar selenium-server-4.0.0.jar node

Node in different machine
java -jar selenium-server-4.0.0.jar node --detect-drivers true --publish-events tcp://{hubIP}:4442 --subscribe-events tcp://{hubIP}:4443
hubIP - Need to connect the IP of the hub with the node (different machine)
